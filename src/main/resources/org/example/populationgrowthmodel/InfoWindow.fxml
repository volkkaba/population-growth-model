Upon describing this growth model, he made the claim that “populations inevitably expand until they outgrow their available food supply, causing the population growth to be reversed by disease, famine, war, or calamity”. He believed that because populations grow exponentially and food supplies grow only arithmetically that all species,including humans, are eventually forced into famine. Although his conclusion is now largely considered to be outdated due to the industrial revolution and other advances made in the last 200 years many still subscribe to his views on overpopulation. Furthermore, though humans may not suffer from a lack of food and water because of a growing scientific field, this is not the case for other species.This means that considering resource supply remains very important when calculating the size of future populations." wrapText="true">

It is however crucial to the proper development of a species. A great example of the importance of this factor are the Universe experiments conducted on mice in the 1970’s. The goal of these experiments was to observe how a species with unlimited supplies of food and water would grow in an enclosure with no predators. John Calhoun the researcher in charge of this enclosure often referred to it as a rodent utopia. He started by placing 8 mice in the biome, it took around 150 days for the mice to become acclimated to this “utopia” but after this initial period the population doubled consistently every 50 days. However, these universes all eventually fell into chaos. As a result of overcrowding, social dynamics became obsolete, the mice became more violent as well as more prone to erratic sexual behavior. This breakdown of social order led the population to rapidly decrease in size as more dominant male mice began eating their own pups. The most shocking part of this experiment to Calhoun was that even after the population decreased back to a reasonable size it was not able to bounce back and instead perished. As a result of this experiments, we learn just how important containment space is for species to thrive." wrapText="true">
